What I learned from Steve's talk:

*   Partner is crucial for a start up.
*   Young man you have to pay for your apartment, so don't forget about your life.
*   You have to do the dirty work by yourself at first.
*   Steve Jobs did a lot sales work when they found Apple, it's quite helpful for the business.
