It&#8217;s really not a suitable title, but just remind myself of what I am doing during the week.</p>
<p>1. Reading</p>
<p>- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mad-Men-Philosophy-Nothing-Blackwell/dp/0470603011/ref=pd_sxp_f_pt">Mad Men and Philosophy: Nothing Is as It Seems</a>, I&#8217;m very like this series. So this book is for review and get more information from this series.</p>
<p>- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Donald-Norman/dp/0385267746">The Design of Everyday Things</a>, it&#8217;s one of the course literature for HCI. I have to say until now, I am very disappointed about this course quality. Hope it will getting better later.</p>
<p>- <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1431177/">藏獒</a>, quite old novel, kind of hot at that time. but I don&#8217;t feel I have the mood to reading this.</p>
<p>- <a href="http://book.douban.com/subject/1082334/">穆斯林葬礼</a>, It seems to be a good one.</p>
<p>- <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/Micro_lee/archive/2007/10/08/1815266.aspx">一位硕士毕业生三个月求职经历与经验的结晶</a>, a job hunting experience from a university master student. Very helpful. We have some similar background, both IT student, finding job, some practical tips.</p>
<p>2. Movie, <a href="http://movie.douban.com/subject/1819388/">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>, mostly it&#8217;s like the game. I don&#8217;t have time to enjoy the game, so movie instead. recommended.</p>
<p>3. Took a <a href="http://www.tudou.com/programs/view/KbmRsxlaR04/">video</a> for embassy.</p>
<p>4. Plan to goto <a href="http://www.worldwaterweek.org/">world water week</a> tomorrow.</p>
