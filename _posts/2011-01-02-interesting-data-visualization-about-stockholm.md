Just found a very interesting data visualization by [Eric Fischer][1] 

![Locals and Tourists #23 (GTWA #19): Stockholm](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4067/4671544537_cf790ff599.jpg)

It's about photography taking in Stockholm. It presented a tourist hot spot.

> Blue points on the map are pictures taken by locals (people who have taken pictures in this city dated over a range of a month or more). 
> Red points are pictures taken by tourists (people who seem to be a local of a different city and who took pictures in this city for less than a month). 
> Yellow points are pictures where it can&#8217;t be determined whether or not the photographer was a tourist (because they haven&#8217;t taken pictures anywhere for over a month). They are probably tourists but might just not post many pictures at all.
