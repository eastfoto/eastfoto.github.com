Although, I upgrade my camera to D600, the truth is I took less photo than before. Sometimes, I will miss my Nikon D80 and the feeling of hangout without perpose but only photography. Just read a post about [top shortcuts for better photos](http://digital-photography-school.com/top-5-shortcuts-for-better-photos), switch to *A* mode is one of that. 

Even more, **Easy Exposure Compensation** is one of the most helpful setting when using Nikon Aperture Priority mode. So you can just use the rotary without pressing the '+/-' button to adjust particular exposure. This setting locate in *CUSTOM SETTING MENU* -- *Metering/exposure* -- *Easy exposure compensation*
