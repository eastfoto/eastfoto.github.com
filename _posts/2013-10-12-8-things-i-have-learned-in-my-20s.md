This Month I will be hitting the major milestone of 30 in my life. Some of you think I'm getting old, others know I have a long way to go before any real wisdom is possible. Regardless I wanted to pass some things off to my friends and also to make sure I'll be able to laugh at myself in ten years for making all the decisions.

1.  **Never be Afraid to Learn Something New.** I planned to learn coding for more than ten times, but until now still a beginner. And usually, each time when I gave up the excuse would be I am too old to learn it. It's for some fresh graduates.
2.  **Time is valuable thing.** You are not young. Don't waste your time just wasting time. Make sure you are fulfilled by each hour you spend, and make meaning.
3.  **Don't Take Family for Granted.** I spent my college in Europe years away from my family so I could have some independence. That's fine, but don't get so busy with your life that you forget to tell your parents how grateful you are and how much you love them. I had a bad decision to working far from my home city, although it seems more opportunities. Now it cost more to go back, if I can choose again, I'd like do anything to go back and spend a little less time at my job and more time with my family.
4.  **Choose Learning Over Money.** When you first get out of school it may be tempting to try and get the highest paying job, but go for the best learning opportunity. It not sprint, its a marathon and the person who chooses learning and mastering skills will inevitably be worth more than the college grad. Choose large company to learn and improve yourself, and express your capability in small one.
5.  **Learn How to Write.** Writing is one of the most important skills which I ignored. This is usually enhanced by one glass of red wine and a nice late night. Make sure to keep it as a habit.
6.  **Learn How to Eat.** Weird how the brain and diet are so connected, and here I was thinking it was all coming from just some deep buried emotions. Not only are there psychological benefits but my blood cholestrol and blood pressure are now healthy.
7.  **Don't be Afraid of People.** Make sure your only motivation is to make friends. This will throw people off for awhile but its very rewarding, and teaches you not to be afraid of people and new relationships.
8.  **Don't Forget to Tell Your Spouse How Much You Love Them.** Sometimes its easy for things to go unsaid and for relationships to fall into roles and for the passion and love to not be as intense as when you first met. But don't do it! Imagine life as if they walked out on you or were in the hospital, you would do anything to get them back, so do it right now!
