很早之前在网上看到的，转载一下。  
Surrounded by forests and water, Stockholm has the feel of a small town. The royal capital of Sweden is actually a collection of islands linked by bridges. To the east, the Baltic Sea bustles with ferries and ships. To the west, Lake Malaren provides plenty of space for water sports and sailing. Stockholm’s residents seem to be more a part of a small community than a sophisticated European city. But they are intensely proud of their city.<span style="color: #888888;"><br /> 斯德哥尔摩为森林和湖海所围绕，很有小乡镇的味道，这个皇家的瑞典首都事实上是众多小岛的结合，其间并以桥梁相连接。在东边，波罗的海上渡船与 各式船只熙来攘往;而西边，则有梅拉伦湖为水上运动和帆船提供广大的空间。虽然斯德哥尔摩的居民似乎比较像是一个小城镇的一部分，而不属于一个高级的欧洲 都市，但是他们确是热切地以他们的城市为荣。</span>  
Stockholmers have good reason to be proud. Their city’s blue waters are so unpolluted that swimming and fishing are possible in the city center. Fishermen catch trout and salmon near the Royal Palace. Swimmers can take a dip within view of the Old Town. This experience is a small miracle that few cities can offer.  
<span style="color: #888888;">斯德哥尔摩的居民的确拥有值得骄傲的理由。这个城市的湛蓝水域非常地洁净未受污染，在市中心都可以游泳或钓鱼，渔夫们可以在皇宫附近捕到鳟鱼和鲑鱼，而游泳者可以在这幅旧城的图画中游泳。这样的经验算是个小小的奇际，而且是很少城市能够提供的。</span>  
Since water defines Stockholm in so many ways, no visitor should miss a tour by boat. Tour boats pass by many of Stockholm’s beautiful bridges, palaces and churches. One of the most famous tours is named &#8220;Under the Bridges of Stockholm.&#8221;  
<span style="color: #888888;">既然湖海是斯德哥尔摩如此重要的特质，游客们就绝对不能错过游船观光。游船会经过许多美丽的桥梁、宫殿、和教堂，其中最有名的游船旅游称为「斯德哥尔摩桥下之旅」。</span>  
The typical boat tour includes the Old Town, or Gamla Stan. Situated on an island, this old city center still looks like a medieval city. The 608-room Royal Palace houses the Royal Armory and the Royal Treasury. The Treasury includes underground rooms where the Crown Jewels are on display. In the State Apartments, the Writing Room of King Oskar II has remained untouched since his death in 1907. The nearby Stockholm Cathedral displays ancient wooden carvings. The 700-year-old Riddarholm Church is the traditional burial place for Swedish kings. Besides historical attractions, Gamla Stan also offers chic shops and world-class restaurants.  
<span style="color: #888888;">典型的游船观光通常会参观旧城区(或称Gamla Stan)，它位于一个岛上是一个古老的市中心，如今仍像一个中世紀的城镇。皇宫中有608个厅室，包括有皇家的军械室和金库，金库还有地下室陈列着皇家 珍宝。在市政府办公大楼中，瑞典国王奥斯卡二世的写字间在1907年他过世后，至今仍保持原状。邻近的斯德哥尔摩大教堂展示着古老的木雕，而长达七百年历 史的利达尔教堂则是传统以来瑞典国王的长眠之处。除了这些历史悠久的观光点之外，旧城区也提供了时髦高级的商店以及世界级的餐厅。</span>  
After leaving the Old Town, the boat tour also goes by City Hall on Lake Malaren. The building’s large square tower rises from the corner facing the water’s edge. Here the king and queen of Sweden look on each year as the Nobel Prize winners receive their awards. The elegant interior includes the famous Blue Room, where the Nobel banquet takes place.  
<span style="color: #888888;">离开了旧城区之后，观光游船还会经过梅拉伦湖畔的市政府大楼，从大楼一角高起了大型的方形高台面向水畔，每年诺贝尔奖得主领奖时，瑞典的国王和皇后都在此观礼。其中幽雅的厅室中包含了有名的蓝厅(Blue Room)，是诺贝尔餐宴举行的地方。</span>  
On the city’s Baltic side, the tour takes visitors past the Skansen Museum. Skansen is an outdoor &#8220;Sweden in miniature.&#8221; The 80-acre park has sections representing the different regions of the country. The visitor can wander from Lapland in the north to Skane in the south. A stroll through the park also takes the visitor through five centuries of Swedish history. Resident craftsmen demonstrate some traditional trades: glass blowing, pottery making and printing. An animal park provides a close-up look at wolves, reindeer and elk, as well as typical farm animals.  
<span style="color: #888888;">旅行团 还会带游客经过史肯恩森博物馆，它位于这个城市靠波罗的海的那一边。史肯恩森可以说是一个戶外的「瑞典小缩影」，这个80英亩的公园被分隔开来以代表国家 中各不同的区域，游客们可以从北部的拉普兰漫游到南方的史肯恩，在园中逛逛的同时也带游客走过了瑞典五个世纪的历史。当地的工艺师父示范着一些那里传统的 生意：吹玻璃、陶器制作、以及印刷业。还有一个动物园可以让人近距离好好地看看狼、驯鹿、麋鹿，和一些典型的牧场动物。</span>  
Also on the Baltic side of the city, the Wasa Museum, the home of the flagship Wasa, stands near the water’s edge. Once the pride of the Swedish navy, the ship sank on its maiden voyage. Now restored, it is a perfect example of a 17th-century seagoing vessel. The thousands of everyday objects recovered with the ship give a fascinating picture of daily life in Sweden 300 years ago.  
<span style="color: #888888;">在市区靠波罗的海沿岸的这边，还有瓦萨博物馆——也就是瓦萨旗舰的所在地。它耸立在岸边，曾经是瑞典海军的骄傲，却在首航时便沉没了。如今被修复的是十七世纪远洋舰艇的绝佳范本，船中放满了数千件的日常用品，为三百年前瑞典的日常生活勾勒出吸引人的图像。</span>  
After a boat tour of the city, the next step should be a trip to some of the 24,000 islands in the beautiful Stockholm archipelago. Some are just rocks; others are green with forests. Many have small villages and country homes. Everyone is welcome to fish, swim and camp.  
<span style="color: #888888;">在搭船参观了此城之后，下一步应该去看看斯德哥尔摩群岛2400个岛中的一些岛了。其中有些纯粹是礁石的岛，有些则布满了绿色的森林，其中很多岛上有小村庄和村舍，它欢迎着大家去钓魚、游泳、和露营。</span>  
As the &#8220;Venice of the North,&#8221; Stockholm takes water seriously. Every August, the city goes all out for the Stockholm Water Festival. The festival sports events and other activities go on 24 hours a day: swimming championships, marathons, music, art and dancing. In the evenings, fireworks light up the sky. The King awards the Stockholm Water Prize for the most outstanding contribution to water conservation. By preserving its precious natural resource, Stockholm has become one of the most pristine cities in the world. It has every reason to celebrate.  
<span style="color: #888888;">身为「北方的威尼斯」，斯德哥尔摩对水非常的重视。每年的八月，整个城市举城欢庆这个斯德哥尔摩水上节庆，这个节庆中的体育竞赛和其他活动都是 全天候24小时进行的：游泳比赛、马拉松赛跑、音乐、艺术和舞蹈。到了晚上，烟火点亮了整个天空，国王会颁发斯德哥尔摩水上奖给对保护水资源最杰出贡献 者。由于保存了其珍贵的天然资源，斯德哥尔摩已经成为世界上极原始纯正的国家之一，他们当然有足够的理由可以好好的庆祝喽。</span>
