###You know you’ve been in Sweden too long, when

1. It seems reasonable that no business can be conducted on Friday afternoons. [or the entire month of July]
2. You become extremely skilled at assembling pre-packaged furniture kits.
3. You wear a dress or skirt over your trousers and combine them with training shoes. [this is especially problematic if you're male]
4. You think black rimmed glasses are cool.
5. Your wardrobe now consists of 20 different shades of black and grey.
6. You've been engaged for four years and don't have any plans to get married.
7. You seriously contemplate getting into H & M.
8. "Candles" are a permanent fixture on your weekly shopping list.
9. You spend the week's entertainment budget on a pack of cigarettes and a drink in Gamla Stan.
10. You reach for your pocket 20 times a day as mobile phones ring all around you.
11. You actually care if your mobile phone meets the fashion standard - and so do your new Swedish friends!
12. You think riding a racing bike in the snow is a perfectly sensible thing to do.
13. You think it's more fun to stay at home and drink then go out.
14. You get extremely annoyed when the bus is two minutes late.
15. You think women are more than equal than men and deserve to have better positions in the work place.
16. Your wife watches TV while you look after the kids.
17. You get into a Mercedes taxi cab and think nothing of it.
18. You lose any artistic talent whatsoever.
19. You rummage through your plastic bag collection to see which ones you should keep to take to the store and which can be sacrificed to garbage.
20. The first thing you do on entering a bank/post office/pharmacy etc. is look for the queue number machine.
21. A sharp intake of breath has become part of your vocabulary, as has the sound ahh'.
22. You associate Friday afternoon with a trip to system bolaget.
23. You think nothing of paying $50 for a bottle of cheap' spirits at system bolaget.
24. Silence is fun.
25. Your native language has seriously deteriorated; you begin to "eat medicine" and "hire videos".
26. Your front door step is beginning to resemble a shoe shop.
27. It seems sensible that the age limit at Stockholm night clubs is 23 or 25.
28. The reason you take the ferry to Finland is: a. duty free vodka b. duty free beer c. to party
29. The fact that all of the "v's" and the "w's" are together in the phone directory seems right.
30. You are no longer scared of volvos and volvo drivers.
31. You use mmmm as a conversation filler.
32. An outside temperature of 9 degrees Celsius is mild.
33. When someone asks for "three cheers", you say "hoorah, hoorah, hoorah, hoorah".
34. You wear sandals with socks.
35. You eat jam with savoury dishes.
36. You have only two facial expressions, smiling or blank.
37. Seeing a young woman with lit candles stuck to her head no longer disturbs you.
38. You wear warm clothing when it's 25 degrees plus in April - because it's April.
39. You wear shorts and t-shirt when it's barely 10 degrees in July - because it's July.
40. You start to think that having a sauna in the nude with a bunch of strangers is a necessary part of daily life and a necessary part of business.
41. Paying $5 for a cup of coffee seems reasonable.
