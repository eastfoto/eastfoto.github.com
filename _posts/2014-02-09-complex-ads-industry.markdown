This photo is from Slusen, Stockholm. I put too much exposure time without tripod when shotting the evening of Slusen. The result is like this, chaos, complexity, and looks like fireworks.

I think the advertising industry is just like this. 

*   All the agencies said they have the technology, but the trueth is the real tech and performance is limited;
*   Click fraud
*   Undertable deals
*   Heavily rely on the relationship
*   Although it's so complex, still it has great prospect just like the **fireworks**.
